results 

stats by single review 
Row	min_length	max_length	avg_length	median_length
1	166	5983	1250.8614097968946	940

that means that average review is around 200-250

stats by total reviews for each movie 
min_total_length	max_total_length	avg_total_length	median_total_length	min_review_number	max_review_number	avg_review_number
52	81735	9168.6246903093361	4739	1	30	7.0786437318609812

This means that max chars for a review is around 81k which is at most 81k/3 < 30k tokens which means this is lower than any models context window 
we are safe to go to just throw em all in there for summarization 

we also have an average of 7 reviews per movie which would be a nice good summary use case 


1	Negative	766	86.067415730337075
2	Positive	124	13.932584269662922

skewed to negative reviews which is interetesting to see, would mean a classifier would have to be evaluated and trained accordingly 
This affects our evaluator agent 
The review would number distribution confirms this: very left tailed skew of 40% 1/10 rating.
